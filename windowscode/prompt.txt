Configure the Windows Powershell to display only the current folder name in the shell prompt

I found this was pretty easy - combining @Synetech's answer and the info found at PowerShell profiles. Because I am a newbie to PS. My steps (for vscode):

1.    test-path $profile (in the PS command prompt - is there a profile set up?)
2.       new-item -path $profile -itemtype file -force (assuming the answer to the above is false)
3.          notepad $profile (opens notepad)

4.    paste in

    function prompt {
      $p = Split-Path -leaf -path (Get-Location)
      "$p> "
    }

5.    save (you shouldn't have to chose a location, it is already done for you)
6.       reload vscode - you will probably get a message about running scripts (or just do next step before reload)

7.    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser (at your PS prompt, from the SuperUse answer)

8.    reload vscode
