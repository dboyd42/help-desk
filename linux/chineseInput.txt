Here is the instructions how to setup Chinese input method in Ubuntu Artful.

    First, go to “Language Support”, make sure the “Chinese(simplified)” or “Chinese Traditional”(or both) is installed completely.

    Go to “Input Method”, make sure you select “ibus” as the selected user configuration. An user logout may be required.

    Go to “Settings -> Region & Language”, in the “Input Sources” section, add the “Chinese(Pinyin)” input method. You can also choose some other Chinese input methods here from the candicate list. For me I like to use “ibus-pinyin” input method which is installed by the “sudo apt-get install ibus-pinyin” command.

Now you should be able to see the input method icon “en/拼” on the top left corner of the desktop. Use “Super + Space” to switch the input method as normal.
