# OneDrive Not Syncing

**Author:** David Boyd<br>

## Issue: Naming Length

:books: The maximum length name of folders and file names are 260 characters!
So when attempting to up/download file name paths, be sure to keep them under
said limit.

### Solution 

#### If syncing is downloading from OneDrive:

1. Go to the [OneDrive website][od] 
2. Move/rename the file to a shorter path name.

#### If syncing is uploading to OneDrive:
1. Locally move/rename the file to a shorter path name.
