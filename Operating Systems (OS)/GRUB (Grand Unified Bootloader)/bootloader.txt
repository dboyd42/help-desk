	            Directories->EFI->Ubuntu:
	                - shimx64.efi       // use for 'secure boot enabled' settings
	                - grubx64.efi       // use for regular boot settings
	                - fwupx63.efi       // a tool used to assist with updating the computer's firmware
	                - grub.cfg          // grub 2's configuration file produced from various scripts
	                - mmx64.efi         // MokManager
	                - BOOTX64.CSV       //
