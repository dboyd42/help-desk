## Introduction

This guide aims to set up a Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) on a home
server, such as a server, desktop, or laptop, with the purpose of creating a
cybersecurity home lab. The lab's main objective is to provide a platform for
practicing penetration testing and incident response techniques. It includes
the setup of various vulnerable boxes and environments, including Active
Directory, to simulate real-world scenarios for hands-on learning.
Additionally, the guide covers configuring secure internet access using
CloudFlare, setting up routing, VLANs, and firewall using pfSense, and
enabling remote accessibility to an attack machine from anywhere in the world.
