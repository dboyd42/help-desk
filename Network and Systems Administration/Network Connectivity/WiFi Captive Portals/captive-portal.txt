Your ISP ues technology known as 'Captive Portal'.  Captive portals work by
<hijacking> the brower's HTTP request and re-directing it to the login portal.

<hijacking:
	- HTTP redirect
	- IMCP redirect
	- DNS hijacking
</hijacking>

*The hijacking doesn't have to be performed by the browser--most modern devices
will automatically run this "captive portal hijacking detection" whenever they
connect to an open WiFi then pop up a dialog allowing your device to go to the
captive portal.*
