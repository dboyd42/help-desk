Explanation
===========

Like the start menu, the desktop is also separated into different accounts, and there's a (shared) public folder which will display desktop icons for all accounts. If you add to, or delete from this folder, then the changes will be reflected in all accounts.

Sometimes, programs install a shortcut to the user account desktop, other times they install to the shared public desktop.

If you want to have different shortcuts on each account, then go to the
C:\Users\GardenMan\Desktop
folder and the
C:\Users\TestUser\Desktop
folder and edit the shortcuts for each individual account.

If you want to add shortcuts to both accounts at the same time, go here:
C:\Users\Public\Public Desktop

Likewise, if you delete a shortcut from your desktop, and it happened to be from the shared public desktop, it will be deleted on all accounts.

    How can I delete desktop shortcuts on one profile without it deleting them from another profile?

That depends on where the shortcut is located, in the public desktop folder, or the user account desktop folder.

The easiest way, move the shortcut from the public desktop folder to the user account desktop folder.

...

The Public desktop is part of what's going on. The icons you see on your Desktop are a combination of the Desktop folder in your profile, the Desktop folder for the Public/All Users profile, and the special My Computer/Recycle Bin/Network/etc icons chosen for your profile.
