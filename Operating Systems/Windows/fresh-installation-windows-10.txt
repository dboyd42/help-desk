Windows Fresh Install
=====================

firefox
WSL
choco install
	[+] vim
	[+] git
		# Troubleshooting: 'git' is not recognized
		I had to close a host of apps to be able to do the installation successfully with:
			choco upgrade git --force
		What needed to be closed included Visual Studio 2019, VS Code, one PowerShell window, Explorer.
		I used Process Explorer tool to find out what was holding handless to git.exe.
