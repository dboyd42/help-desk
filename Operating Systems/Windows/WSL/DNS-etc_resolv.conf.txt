Nameserver Keeps Resetting Causing No-Connectivity Issues
#########################################################
:Status: Resolved
:Summary: WSL keeps resetting /etc/resolv.conf DNS address
:Root Issue: Symlink between /etc/resolv.conf -> ../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf

Solution
========

Reinstall Windows 10 --keeping all files
Reinstall WSL

/etc/resolv.conf -> ../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf

This will fuck up your LAN connections
=======================================

.. code-block:: Bash

	sudo unlink /etc/resolv.conf
	# replace /etc/resolv.conf ip address to your liking
	# such as, 8.8.8.8 or your Pi-Hole

Is Powershell: wsl --shutdown still required?

My Solution
===========

.. code-block:: Bash

	cp /etc/resolv.conf /etc/wsl.conf
	# uncomment lines 2 and 3
	sudo vim /etc/wsl.conf

	# softlink that shit
	sudo ln -sf /etc/resolv.conf /etc/wsl.conf

.. code-block:: Powershell

	# shutdown WSL through here!
	wsl --shutdown

Restart WSL and you now have persistance!

Original Solution
=================
:URL:  https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4285

Create a file: /etc/wsl.conf.
Put the following lines in the file

	[network]
	generateResolvConf = false

In a cmd window, run
	wsl --shutdown

Restart WSL2
Create a file: /etc/resolv.conf. If it exists, replace existing one with this new file.
Put the following lines in the file

	nameserver 8.8.8.8

	Repeat step 3 and 4. You will see git working fine now.
